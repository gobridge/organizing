# Organizing and sponsoring a GoBridge event

## Requirements
### Must have

  Note: It is not required that organizers/instructors/TAs are part of a underrepresented group.

For any event, remember the mission of GoBridge is to diversify and improve the tech community. We ask that:

- Your event reaches out to a group of people who are underrepresented **in your local community**. That might be women, people of color, people with low-income, LGBTQIA, people with disabilities, older professionals, non-native English speakers, or any other underrepresented group.

- Your event is free for people to attend. We want to remove as many barriers to entry as possible.

- All GoBridge work is done on a volunteer basis; no one who works to further the GoBridge cause gets paid for that work.

- GoBridge abides by the [Go code of conduct with a GoBridge addendum](http://coc.golangbridge.org) and we expect all GoBridge events and initiatives to do the same.

If an event does not meet all of those requirements, anyone is welcome to use the GoBridge material, but the event can't be called a GoBridge event.

### Optional
- If you do not belong to an underrepresented group and would like to help setup an event, it is best to find someone who represents the group to be the lead. Help them own and run the event and be there to provide support.

- The BridgeFoundry Bridges have a tradition of allowing other people to attend as a guest of a person who the workshop is reaching out to, but that is totally optional. The important thing is that the workshop brings more diverse people into tech in a welcoming, supportive environment.
